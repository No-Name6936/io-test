# Overview
Read in a CSV and print it out as a user-friendly table with this simple script!

**Usage**
- Specify the filename of your CSV (must be in the same directory as the .jar file)
- Specify how much of the CSV you'd like to see, in columns (5, 10, 12, all, etc.)
That's it! The script does the rest.
